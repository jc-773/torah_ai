#torahAI - front end 

## Background
This is the very basic chat UI for torahAI
  - the backend can be found in the torahAI_backend repository
I used python and streamlit to build it (https://docs.streamlit.io/)


## Environment setup
Create a virtual environment for your Python project
python3 -m venv env_name
Activate the newly created environment - source env_name/bin/activate
Once your env is up and running, you can install your packages - pip install package_name

## Running a streamlit project
Navigate to the root directory of the project
cd project_name
Run the project with the following command - streamlit run project_name.py
This will open a tab in your default browser
