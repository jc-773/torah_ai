# torahAI - front end 

## Background
This is the very basic POC chat UI for torahAI - I used python and streamlit to build it (https://docs.streamlit.io/)
  - the backend can be found in the torahAI_backend repository
  - as of now, this is just a monolithic application - as the UI and the backend requests are all together


## Environment setup
Create a virtual environment for your Python project
  - python3 -m venv env_name
  - Activate the newly created environment - source env_name/bin/activate
  - Once your env is up and running, you can install your packages - pip install package_name

## Running a streamlit project
  - Navigate to the root directory of the project
  - cd project_name
  - Run the project with the following command - streamlit run main_file.py
  - This will open a tab in your default browser with a chat session

## What next?
  - I plan on adding session management
  - A few more personlized enhancements to the UI
