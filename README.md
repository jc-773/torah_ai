# torahAI - front end 

## Background
  - This is a simple streamlit client for torahAI backend
  - Must have an openAI API key for it to work
  - Unless backend jar is running locally this client won't work. I just containerized the backend and will deploy to prod soon...

## Environment setup
  - Create a virtual environment for your Python project
  - python3 -m venv env_name
  - Activate the newly created environment - source env_name/bin/activate
  - Once your env is up and running, you can install your packages - pip install package_name

## Running a streamlit project
  - Navigate to the root directory of the project
  - cd project_name
  - Run the project with the following command - streamlit run main_file.py
  - This will open a tab in your default browser with a chat session
